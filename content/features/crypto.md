The main idea behind the app was to streamline the process of acquiring cryptocurrency for the average citizen. With Swish e-commerce integration and minimal personal information required from customers the order flow could be made fast & efficient."
dev_description: "The app was made as a proof of concept for a fintech startup and was mainly built with react, nodejs, mongodb and features SSR. The app integrates with various external API's & services such as API's for FX rates, Swish e-commerce & Crypto exchanges, always with redundancy in mind. The app includes a full admin panel, and features a completely automated order to deliver flow with the exception of signing crypto transactions, which can be made in bulk and offline with a hardware wallet for additional security."
